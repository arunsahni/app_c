Hello Nabeel,

As you were updated that Dipin is no more associated with Smart-Data so, from now onwards we will work for this project and will use the Base-Camp as the medium of communication regarding the progress and point of discussion related the functionality and the other enhancement as we will work ahead.

As We are new to this project and needs more clearance than the central idea which is related to the creation of the adds with the involvement of the clients and the publications which are compatible to the different devices.  To have the clear picture we need more clearance regarding the concept and also the detailed discussion needs to have the clear picture of the modules which will further collectively called as the application.

I am also looking forward to work with you on this project ,Yes there are many things to discuss.

kindly update us regarding your availability over the Skype(Our office timings are 9:00am to 6:30pm IST) , so that we have better understanding and will start with the right strategy and in the right direction.

Have great time.

//////////////////////////// 17 September //////////////////////////


Hello Nabeel,

Please find the below mentioned.

Nabeel : Is this just around access control and what type of users can do what on the site?

Mohinder : Yes. it's around the Access Control displaying what type of users can perform/view what sort of function/feature.

Nabeel : In the green boxes in your workflow diagram, does those mean the
features/functions that the entity can view/perform?

Mohinder : Yes, the green boxes mean the features/functions that the entity can view/perform.

Nabeel :  How many super admins will there be? Perhaps the real question is if there will be more than 1.

Mohinder : Super Admin is only one.

Nabeel :  Super Admin should also be able to access Brands Overview

Mohinder : Yes. Super admin can view the Brands over view along with all the other entities present over the application. except if some thing we will find illogical as per point of functionality in the coming time as we will swift with the functionality.

Nabeel : Super Admin should be able to CRUD anything (agencies, brands,
publications, advertisements, users)

Mohinder : No Super Admin can't CRUD anything as we are making sections dependable and managed by particular sections.

In spite Super Admin can enable/disable any agency , any manager and any user and this will be effective in the hierarchy e.g if admin can disable any agency then the manager associated with that agency and the user associated with that agency will also be disabled.

Nabeel :  Agency is a user-less entity and is managed by an Agency Manager; do you see it this way?

Mohinder : If Agency is created by Super Admin then the Agency is user-less entity and as created by Super Admin it can be managed by Super Admin only and not by the decedents of agency like Agency manager. As Agency Manager will be created by Agency which is lower in hierarchy from Agency.

Also there are more than one Agency manager and thus make the situation ambiguous if all the manager will try to manage their agency.

Nabeel : No user or agency can self-register; only the Super Admin can create an agency and agency manager

Mohinder : if is it so then there is no Signup/Register Form in the application. is it?

As per our point if Super Admin is going to create the Agency then it should limit up to the creation of Agency and not create the Agency Manager and Agency user

As per our understanding :-

There is one Super Admin

This Super admin will create Agency and manage these agency.

These Agencies will create the Agency Manager or Agency user as required, means if need to have Agency manager then will create the Agency manager otherwise create the agency user.

Nabeel :  The Agency Manager can CRUD Agency Users and also manage the Agency profile (like update logo, description, etc.)

Mohinder : Yes, Agency Manager can CRUD Agency Users and will not manage the Agency Profile. Agency Profile will be managed by Super Admin only.


Nabeel :  All users in the system (besides Super Admin) will have some sort of relationship with an agency/brand/publication; but really an agency since
the setup for brands/publications who want to manage their own ads will
require them to create an agency entity.

Mohinder : Yes, but now As discussed above the Agency will be created by the Super Admin so brands/publications who want to manage their own ads will require them to contact Super-admin and Super-admin will create an agency entity.

Nabeel :  Agency managers should be able to do everything the Agency User can, like CRUD advertisements, create embed code, etc.

Mohinder : These Agency manager will do their role and the Agency users will do their.

Agency Manger:
create the agency user and all CRUD operation for the user

Agency User:
Create the ad and all CRUD operation for the ad.

Nabeel :  We also need to discuss who can access the reports and what those will look like, but perhaps that is later?

Mohinder : Yes Once we will finalize with the above mentioned we will discuss regarding the reporting too.


//////////////////////////  18 September /////////////////////////////

Date: September 17, 2014.

Duration:  1:00 hrs.

Attendees:   Mohinder, Nabeel

Agenda:   Number of user's and their roles in the application

Discussion:

The meeting started with the super admin and the other type of roles as mentioned below.

a) Nabeel update us that there will be two admins for the site the one is as the super admin and the other one is Sub admin

 
b) We discussed regarding the earlier provided workflow and the client update us that there were not many employee heirarchy so we not needed the agency Manager heirarchy and need to remove the same from the heirarchy in such a manner that Agency/Client will create the Agency User and not the Ageny Manager.

c) The Sub Admin will go to create the Agency/Client and manage the same in place of the Super-Admin. The Sub admin will also create the Brand and the Publications and manages the same.
   The Sub admin will also create the Agency user. When they will do so they will assign the Agency/ client while creating the Agency user.

We update the client that we will provide another Work flow diagram for the same and will discuss the rest of things in the next call.


Kindly find the attached document as "Revised_user_roles_workflow.png" and confirm if all the points discussed have been covered in this, and let us know if there is any modification that might be required.

The meeting started with the discussion of Create Ad module functionality :

Nabeel : The Agency Users Which are created By ageny or by Sub-admin will create the ad.

SDM : How they will create the ad?
Nabeel : To create the add, the agency user log-in to the Pogovor user panel. There they will go to advertisement link. Here they will navigate to the UI which have the specified fields, with which the ad will be created.

Nabeel : For the time being the Fields are as below and further will provide the exact set of fields to Create ad form.
a) Name
b) Title
c) Description

SDM : Who will create the embed code?
Nabeel : Agency User will create the embed code. To create the Embed code, the agency user log-in to the Pogovor user panel. There they will go to generate link. From there the user will create the embed code which will further use to integrate with the ad's.


SDM : Will the embed code will created for the whole ad or it will be for the text box (what is called as pogovor ad)?
Nabeel: The ad is separate from the embed code. The Embed code will be generated separately. The embed code will be generated for the Text Box, Which is build so that it can be best fitted in the different devices and different adds and enclosed with the functionality able to search against specific keywords which in turn queries with data base at our servers.

SDM : How the embed code will communicate or will be identified by our database or functionality?
Nabeel : The embed code generated have the unique id and that is in our database.   

SDM : Will the entity(agency or agency user) which will use the embed code knows prior wherever the code is being used so to make the database rich regarding the questionnaire keywords.
Nabeel: In some cases It is prior known regarding the destination ad and so the information regarding that ad is kept in database and used at the time searching through the keywords by the end user. 
But in most cases it is not not known prior where and what type of ad is to be used with the pogovor ad and here when end user first time query some stuff that will be saved in database as per the unique id and the rest flow will be discussed in the upcoming discussions.

SDM : Will we have to follw the MRAID specification or use the sdk or libraray.
Nabeel : We have to make the embed code able to satisfy the MRAID specification and also other's like Adobe DPS and not use the SDK or Libraray.
 
b) In the Add Agency/agency User Screen we discussed regarding some of the fields and their scopes are as defined below;

1) User Name
SDM : Should we Keep field username in the form(agency and agency user) as the username will be automatically set as per the Name.
Nabeel : Remove the field as this is the system generated as per the Name of the Agency.
If Name have space in between the Two words then the space will be spliced.
Example : if the Name is "The Name" then the Space is being splice and the name is being treated as "TheName" and so the username as per. if already existed then it will be as the "TheName-1" instead of "TheName-01".

2) Email 
SDM : Is Email will be unique for the Agency.
Nabeel : Yes it will be.

   	 We replied that the username and the Password will be emailed to the respective agency or agency users e-mail. Once they will get the email they will login with the credentials provided and have to change the password as this is one time password.

4) Image formats.
SDM : #) We have allowed three formats to be uploaded. 
              a) JPEG
             	 b) GIF
             	 c) PNG

Hello Nabeel,

Hope doing great.

Below mentioned is our side understanding for the ad creation and the embed Code generation going through the different dimension testing. If some where you feels that needs to be amendment please mention it out and we will finalize the things in the  next successive Skype call.

Ths flow is as follows:

a) Agency User log in to the Agency User Panel.

b) In the Agency User Panel the Agency user will click on the Create Advertisement. upon doing so, Agency-user will navigated to Create Ad form.

c) Create ad form will have meta data options like Name . Desciption, image formats(dimensions). 

d) For image formats(dimensions) we need to give option for user, then user can select multiple image formats(e.g. 300x250, 160x600) from listing.(Needs this to discuss in detail like whether there will be limited no of predefined options or will enterd in the text Box or there will be some default dimesion to be selected and other to be supplied on the user's wish).

e) Agency User fill the  metadata for an Ad and clicks on the create Ad Button. As the user will create the ad functionality will take the control or navigate the user to the ad listing Page having options such as view ad, edit ad, delete ad.

f) When user clicks on view icon a new page will open that contain all info and multiple image formats (that user selected) for an Ad. 

(Need to be discuss: on Ad view page how user can place input box? Is there any default "input box" that need to drag and drop on different image formats? and needs to be customized the look and location of the text box for each format.
Once done, User will click on Generate Embed Code,the resulting embed code will provide the specifications for the text-box layout for the selected 
formats(dimensions).

We had certain questions for till now regarding the above mentioned. Once we will achieve this Functionality freeze we will start discussing how the input box will communicate like the demo site do and will finalize the functionality flow).

Have great time.
